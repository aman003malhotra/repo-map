# Project Completion Log

## Step 1: Project Setup

- Initialized npm project with `npm init -y`.
- Created base directory structure: `src/`, `graph_construction/`, `knowledge_graph/`, `types/`, `utils/`.
- Installed core and dev dependencies:
  - `typescript`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `ts-node`, `web-tree-sitter`, `jsnetworkx`, `neo4j-driver`, `simple-git`, `commander`, `axios`, `dotenv`
  - `@types/node` as a dev dependency
- Confirmed that `.env` with Neo4j credentials already exists.
- Using system Node.js version as per user instruction.

## Step 2: Project Configuration

- Created TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) with output to `dist/` directory.
- Added ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc.json`) with basic rules.
- Added Prettier configuration (`.prettierrc`) for code formatting.
- Updated `package.json` with proper scripts, metadata, and keywords.
- Created `.gitignore` file to exclude common directories and files.
- Updated `README.md` with project information, usage examples, and development setup.

## Step 3: Core Implementation - Initial Structure

- Created type definitions in `src/types/index.ts`:
  - `RepoInfo` interface for repository metadata
  - `Tag` interface for code elements
  - `GraphNodeData` and `GraphEdgeData` interfaces for graph structure
  - `Neo4jNodeData` and `Neo4jRelationshipData` interfaces for database operations
  - `Graph` interface for graph operations
- Implemented utility functions in `src/utils/utils.ts`:
  - `isLikelyTextFile` to detect text files
  - `generateNodeId` for unique node identification
  - `getLanguageFromExtension` to determine programming language
  - Various helper functions for file operations
- Implemented repository fetcher in `src/graph_construction/repo-fetcher.ts`:
  - Support for Git repositories via cloning
  - Support for local directories
  - Repository metadata extraction
- Implemented repository scanner in `src/graph_construction/repo-scanner.ts`:
  - Recursive directory traversal
  - File filtering based on extension and content
  - Async generator pattern for memory efficiency
- Created main entry point in `src/index.ts`:
  - Command-line interface using Commander
  - Main workflow orchestration
  - Error handling and logging

## Step 4: Core Implementation - Graph Construction and Database Integration

- Implemented code parser in `src/graph_construction/code-parser.ts`:
  - Tree-sitter integration for parsing code files
  - Extraction of code definitions and references
  - Language detection and grammar loading
- Implemented graph builder in `src/graph_construction/graph-builder.ts`:
  - In-memory graph representation using jsnetworkx
  - Node and edge creation for code elements
  - Relationship establishment between code elements
  - Implementation of the Graph interface
- Implemented Neo4j service in `src/graph_construction/neo4j-service.ts`:
  - Connection to Neo4j database
  - Batch operations for node and relationship creation
  - Index management for efficient queries
  - Query interface for graph operations
- Implemented embedding service in `src/knowledge_graph/embedding-service.ts`:
  - Simulated embedding generation for code elements
  - Semantic search capabilities (placeholder implementation)

**Next Steps:**
- Add Tree-sitter query files for different languages
- Implement real embedding generation using a vector model
- Add tests for core functionality
- Create example projects for demonstration
